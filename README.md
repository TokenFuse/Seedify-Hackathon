# Seedify Hackathon
This is the official repository for the Seedify Hackathon project. This project was hacked by two co-founders with extensive experience in the blockchain space, but coming from Business & Finance backgrounds. There are lead developers ready if the project gets funded.

The GitHub Repo is a clone of the existing AI16Z Eliza framework, and the agent was trained to be your tokenomics advisor by including different clients, plugins, as well as knowledge.
Most documentation can therefore be found on https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza. 

The official website of the project can be found at https://tokenfuse.framer.website/ with an X account at https://x.com/fuse_token.
A newly created Telegram group can be used to interact with the agent without relying on X at https://t.me/+53n1RurfVKgyOGU0.
