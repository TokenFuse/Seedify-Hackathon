        "Tokenomics is vital to blockchain builders because it’s one of the most powerful tools to direct user behaviors, it can play a crucial role in overcoming the “cold start problem” to reaching critical mass, and it can sustain community engagement via user ownership. Blockchain product users cannot be explicitly forced to do something or prevented from doing it—they must be incentivized to do it or avoid doing it. Even the best products, concepts, or communities can be ruined by poor tokenomics that result in warped incentives, as seen in examples like Steemit, Iron/Titan, or Luna/UST. Network effects are built by reaching a critical mass before competitors. Because smart contracts and on-chain user data can be easily copied, network effects become a relatively more important part of defensibility, even if network effects for blockchain products tend to be weaker than those for Web2 products. If your product cannot stand on its own, and users do not use it for any reason other than earning token rewards, such rewards will attract the wrong kind of users. Network effects kick in once a product unlocks large enough value to each user. Aggregate value is correlated with, but not identical to, the total number of users. Attracting value-add users is the crucial aspect. Tokenomics can help overcome the bootstrapping problem, but when done poorly, such as handing out tokens to reward any network activity instead of rewarding value-added activities, tokens can be net destructive to network value and growth. The ultimate promise of tokens is enabling distributed ownership: not shareholder-owned, not employee-owned, but user-owned.",
        "Tokenomics is the set of economic and non-economic (governance) rules a protocol employs to incentivize user coordination towards a specific goal, even when individual users hold uncorrelated or conflicting goals. While many concepts and approaches from traditional economics carry over to tokenomics, not all do, especially within the context of gaming. Tokenomics is not the same as the product. In nearly all cases, the product could exist without the token, but the token cannot exist sustainably without the product. Great products or, at the very least, great product concepts come first, before the token and tokenomics. For example, in the cases of Uniswap, MakerDAO, and Chainlink, their tokenomics make an already good product even stronger. Enabling user ownership is a powerful advantage of Web3 models for user retention, one that Web2 companies are trying to emulate. It’s relatively easier to design mechanisms for incentivizing behaviors requiring low-frequency engagement, such as providing liquidity or mining, compared to high-frequency engagement behaviors, which are more difficult to design without creating potential exploits and abuses. Even then, all incentives come with trade-offs, and it’s important to think through and simulate potential side effects beforehand. Poorly designed tokenomics create economic risks that smart contract audits cannot catch; these are not errors in code but errors in incentive structures. Such flaws can lead to poor user experiences (e.g., Solana’s downtime or Steemit’s spam content) or total protocol collapse (e.g., Terra, Iron Finance, Mango). Regulation is becoming more important to blockchain builders, with the SEC clamping down on Coinbase and accusing at least nine tokens of making unregistered securities offerings, as well as the recent sanctioning of Tornado Cash. This includes censorship of addresses associated with Tornado Cash transactions and even the arrest of a developer in the Netherlands who contributed to Tornado Cash’s open-source code. Just because a product creates value does not necessarily mean it captures any of that value—it depends on the business model and tokenomics. It’s possible to capture value (e.g., product or protocol revenues) without any of that value accruing to the token or token holders. For example, for its first year, Curve captured protocol revenues but did not direct revenues to token holders in any way.",
        "A good product does not mean you automatically have good tokenomics. Beware assuming your token will act as a store of value or a medium of exchange, or will automatically appreciate in value as the product gains users. This is a telltale amateur mistake. Good tokenomics are win-win-win: the builders win (note that “fair launches” are not necessarily best), the product wins, and the holders win. While it’s obvious that too much supply going to contributors can be detrimental, a so-called “fair launch” where contributors get too little of the supply can be just as bad. Bad tokenomics designs can be recognized from their unsustainable claims, untested assumptions, misaligned incentives for user behavior versus desired user behavior, reliance on “price go up,” or reliance on transferring the economic activity of new users directly to old users instead of creating value and distributing that value. When the token does not make the product better in a clear way (other than raising money), it’s a strong sign that the token has not been well designed. Be especially wary about your token mechanisms when designing products that involve collateral assets and/or oracles. While builders may be wary of chasing users off with tokenomics that ask holders to take on risks, designs that offer holders both benefits and put their skin-in-the-game may actually lead to the best results.",
        "Launching a token has both pros and cons, and builders need to carefully weigh them, as once launched, it’s very difficult to gracefully “unlaunch” a token—doing so almost always wastes time and damages reputation. Pros include easier fundraising, benefiting user acquisition, enabling community ownership, supporting multichain functionality, and enabling new products. Cons include reputation risk or damage, legal risks, diverting resources from the core product, and introducing additional complexities and economic exploit risks that smart contract audits are not designed to catch. This checklist helps builders determine whether it may be appropriate to launch a token and, if so, when the right time may be to do so. You probably don’t ever need a token if you don’t meet the following criteria. At least one of the following must apply: the product intends to be either fully decentralized, permissionless, or community-owned/operated; the token benefits the product itself (e.g., the product will be faster, simpler, less expensive, more secure, etc., than possible without a token); or the token will be a native form of gas or currency to a chain, or it represents or tracks a value pegged to an off-chain or on-chain asset (e.g., stablecoins, carbon credits). Additionally, at least one of the following must apply: the token is used for reputation (not transferable, no explicit monetary value); the token has legitimate use cases and utility for holders (providing liquidity, staking to earn more of the same token, and price speculation trading are not legitimate utilities); or the token can financially reward holders via buybacks, revenue distributions, or similar mechanisms funded by paying users of the protocol, not ponzinomic transfers of wealth (you must be conscious of legal/regulatory aspects if this is the option you’re relying on—speak to your legal representation). Even if you need a token at some point, you probably aren’t ready to launch one until you meet these additional criteria. Launching the token now will materially help with at least one of the following: attracting new users you are able to retain (you have product-market fit); retaining existing users (even when emissions decline); protecting from competitors (defending against a vampire attack); or enabling significant community control and governance (not decentralization theater). Additionally, at least one of the following must be true: the core team is prepared to operate a “public company”; the core team is ready to fully abdicate responsibility to token holders, and token holders are ready to take full control of day-to-day governance and operations; or there is no “core team” to begin with, or all of the contracts have been deployed and are non-upgradeable and immutable (e.g., Bitcoin or Liquity). At least one of the following must also apply: the product has achieved “sufficient decentralization” (legal risks may still apply); you will not be selling tokens to unaccredited US investors (there may still be regulatory implications for tokens given away for free to these investors); or you have registered your token offering sale with the SEC or the relevant regulator for your jurisdiction such as the MAS in Singapore. Furthermore, your token launch plan must have been reviewed by a knowledgeable legal professional. The simple framework at the end of the chapter can help to quickly evaluate if a token is right for your product and if now is the right time.",
        "Regulatory bodies in Switzerland and Singapore have similar guidance on token classes for payment, utility, and securities/assets, though these classes are not mutually exclusive. Unofficial industry classifications of tokens do not assume tokens are necessarily fungible tokens rather than non-fungible tokens, and in many cases, such as reputation, governance, pegged, and more, can make use of NFTs or FTs. It is generally unwise to launch a non-stablecoin token meant to function as a medium of exchange unless it is within a very specific economy, such as an in-game currency. It is extremely difficult to retain a strict peg without the option to redeem the token for the underlying pegged asset, no matter how liquid or illiquid that asset may be. Governance tokens create additional room for abuses, exploits, and malicious governance takeovers, in addition to handing potential control of crucial aspects of the product to users who sometimes have drastically less domain expertise. Community governance is not required to build decentralized or user-owned products; it is a subjective political decision or design objective—not a technical requirement, and often not a regulatory requirement either. Always speak to a registered legal professional before launching a token. L1, L2, and dApp tokens will almost always have different objectives. Blindly copy-pasting L1 tokenomics into the context of a dApp, or vice versa, is not sound design.",
        "The biggest tokenomics mistakes to avoid: Not Knowing Why You Need a Token: The most common mistake builders make is not knowing why or how a token will actually benefit your product and your users. These builders are often interested in launching a token purely to raise money and then try to work backward to create a need for the token. Just as you wouldn’t start a company “in order to be an entrepreneur,” launching a token “to have a token” is not the right approach. Both crypto and traditional business models alike start with solving a problem and creating something useful that people want or need. Consider revisiting Chapter 1.4 to evaluate if a token actually makes sense for your situation. Not Planning Ahead: Whereas the first mistake is having a token before a product, the second mistake is having a product that isn’t designed with a token in mind and then launching a token after the fact without considering the product implications. For example, Uniswap is still struggling to activate the “fee switch,” and until they do, the UNI token is purely a governance token with dubious value beyond speculation that UNI will capture fees in the future. Part of this may have been due to the fact that the launch of UNI was largely rushed to defend against the SushiSwap vampire attack. Uniswap could have still launched their product first and their token later—doing so remains a common tactic for many crypto products. However, when doing so, it’s important to plan ahead for how the token fits into and benefits the product, even if you have no plans to actually launch the token yet. In Uniswap’s case, that could have meant turning on a very small protocol fee or having the treasury collect a protocol fee and still distribute it to LPs. This way the overall economics for traders and LPs would remain the same, but a product mechanism for collecting fees to the treasury would already exist and merely need to be re-activated instead of implemented from scratch. We’ll discuss Uniswap’s situation and token value accrual more in Chapter 2.2. Not Knowing What Type of Token You’re Issuing: Another common mistake is not knowing what type of token you’re issuing—for example, thinking your token is a utility token merely because it has one minor piece of utility when in reality it possesses many characteristics of an asset token. This increases your legal risk since you don’t know how your token will likely fit into existing regulatory frameworks that specify specific token types. It also makes it easy to fool yourself into excusing a poorly designed token that has no utility by assuming that your token will be used as a medium of exchange (currency) or a store of value (e.g., Bitcoin, gold). In reality, the vast majority of tokens will never become a store of value or general medium of exchange, and assuming it will, or using a design that requires it to, is delusional. Along the same lines, if you’re introducing a utility token, make sure it has actual utility. Taking a useless token and adding staking to earn more of the same token does not give it utility. Revisit Chapter 1.5 for more about types of tokens and different forms of utility. Relying on Always Increasing Prices: Builders that optimize for “number go up technology” will find that all the growth that seems to come as the token price rises will just as quickly evaporate once the price declines. Builders cannot rely on prices always going up. Volatility and random events are part of life. People sell tokens for all sorts of rational and irrational reasons. Risks and rewards are subjective, and users will eventually sell tokens even if they “shouldn’t” do it. Sustainably incentivizing holding is one thing, but designing mechanisms that strictly prevent selling, or assuming no one will ever sell, is a surefire way to destroy your product. If your token is built assuming no one will ever sell, user activity will always grow, or your token price will always increase, your product will not survive. Underestimating Collateral Risks: Using collateral is sometimes unavoidable. For example, enabling users to mint DAI requires them to post collateral. If you mint DAI without collateral, there would be nothing backing the stablecoin, and the entire product simply would not work. Yet even when strictly necessary, collateral always means risk. Looking at surface-level assumptions of price, market cap, and market liquidity can be extremely misleading when assessing these risks. Market cap structurally overestimates the value of collateral when the value of that collateral is most important—when people start selling it. Builders too often overestimate the value, liquidity, and diversification of collateral assets because they make assumptions based on normal market conditions, not based on conditions during market downturns when collateral liquidations would be occurring. We’ll discuss risk modeling more and introduce a specific framework for assessing and managing risk in Chapter 2.6. Assuming Product Usage Means Token Demand: It’s common to assume the more a product is used, the more demand for the token there’ll be—however, this is not necessarily the case and heavily depends on a product’s tokenomics. Devoid of clear value capture and value accrual, there is often no fundamental reason more usage translates into more demand. Assuming product usage translates to token demand is not realistic; it depends on the tokenomics, especially on the utility, value capture, and value accrual mechanisms. Only Focusing on Token Supply: When discussing tokenomics, people almost always discuss allocation, emission schedules, inflation rates, burns, the total number of tokens, and tokens in circulation. Yet these are all supply aspects, and supply is only one piece of the puzzle. Scarcity alone is not enough. Reducing inflation is not enough. Removing sell pressure is not enough. Deflationary pressures that are not properly balanced can paralyze economic activity since people begin to hoard the token instead of using it for its intended purpose. Builders need to think about token demand, use cases, incentive mechanisms, and value drivers just as much, if not more, than supply. Not Modeling and Stress Testing: Incentives are tough to get right, and even if the overall system is sound in design, it is highly unlikely that you pick the optimal parameters without modeling and stress testing. Many builders don’t know where to start with optimization and testing, resulting in arbitrary emissions schedules, undetected death spirals, hidden assumptions, and unrealistic expectations of risk. Methods such as Monte Carlo simulations, boundary testing, and scenario analysis, which are common in TradFi and systems engineering, could help identify risks early. Every serious builder knows to audit their smart contracts, but ensuring the code is supposed to do the right thing is even more important. Ignoring Regulatory Risks: Crypto founders have gone to jail for ignoring regulatory risks. Take it seriously. Just because someone else uses a certain tokenomics model and hasn’t yet been sued or arrested doesn’t mean the same applies to you. Life’s not fair. The recent crackdowns on Tornado Cash, including the arrest of a developer guilty of the ‘crime’ of contributing code to an open-source project, highlight the importance of taking regulatory risks seriously. This guide is not legal advice, but Chapter 2.7 compiles informational tips and resources from legal professionals in the industry."
