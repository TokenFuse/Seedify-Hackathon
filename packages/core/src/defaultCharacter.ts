        "Tokenomics is vital to blockchain builders because it’s one of the most powerful tools to direct user behaviors, it can play a crucial role in overcoming the “cold start problem” to reaching critical mass, and it can sustain community engagement via user ownership. Blockchain product users cannot be explicitly forced to do something or prevented from doing it—they must be incentivized to do it or avoid doing it. Even the best products, concepts, or communities can be ruined by poor tokenomics that result in warped incentives, as seen in examples like Steemit, Iron/Titan, or Luna/UST. Network effects are built by reaching a critical mass before competitors. Because smart contracts and on-chain user data can be easily copied, network effects become a relatively more important part of defensibility, even if network effects for blockchain products tend to be weaker than those for Web2 products. If your product cannot stand on its own, and users do not use it for any reason other than earning token rewards, such rewards will attract the wrong kind of users. Network effects kick in once a product unlocks large enough value to each user. Aggregate value is correlated with, but not identical to, the total number of users. Attracting value-add users is the crucial aspect. Tokenomics can help overcome the bootstrapping problem, but when done poorly, such as handing out tokens to reward any network activity instead of rewarding value-added activities, tokens can be net destructive to network value and growth. The ultimate promise of tokens is enabling distributed ownership: not shareholder-owned, not employee-owned, but user-owned.",
        "Tokenomics is the set of economic and non-economic (governance) rules a protocol employs to incentivize user coordination towards a specific goal, even when individual users hold uncorrelated or conflicting goals. While many concepts and approaches from traditional economics carry over to tokenomics, not all do, especially within the context of gaming. Tokenomics is not the same as the product. In nearly all cases, the product could exist without the token, but the token cannot exist sustainably without the product. Great products or, at the very least, great product concepts come first, before the token and tokenomics. For example, in the cases of Uniswap, MakerDAO, and Chainlink, their tokenomics make an already good product even stronger. Enabling user ownership is a powerful advantage of Web3 models for user retention, one that Web2 companies are trying to emulate. It’s relatively easier to design mechanisms for incentivizing behaviors requiring low-frequency engagement, such as providing liquidity or mining, compared to high-frequency engagement behaviors, which are more difficult to design without creating potential exploits and abuses. Even then, all incentives come with trade-offs, and it’s important to think through and simulate potential side effects beforehand. Poorly designed tokenomics create economic risks that smart contract audits cannot catch; these are not errors in code but errors in incentive structures. Such flaws can lead to poor user experiences (e.g., Solana’s downtime or Steemit’s spam content) or total protocol collapse (e.g., Terra, Iron Finance, Mango). Regulation is becoming more important to blockchain builders, with the SEC clamping down on Coinbase and accusing at least nine tokens of making unregistered securities offerings, as well as the recent sanctioning of Tornado Cash. This includes censorship of addresses associated with Tornado Cash transactions and even the arrest of a developer in the Netherlands who contributed to Tornado Cash’s open-source code. Just because a product creates value does not necessarily mean it captures any of that value—it depends on the business model and tokenomics. It’s possible to capture value (e.g., product or protocol revenues) without any of that value accruing to the token or token holders. For example, for its first year, Curve captured protocol revenues but did not direct revenues to token holders in any way.",
        "A good product does not mean you automatically have good tokenomics. Beware assuming your token will act as a store of value or a medium of exchange, or will automatically appreciate in value as the product gains users. This is a telltale amateur mistake. Good tokenomics are win-win-win: the builders win (note that “fair launches” are not necessarily best), the product wins, and the holders win. While it’s obvious that too much supply going to contributors can be detrimental, a so-called “fair launch” where contributors get too little of the supply can be just as bad. Bad tokenomics designs can be recognized from their unsustainable claims, untested assumptions, misaligned incentives for user behavior versus desired user behavior, reliance on “price go up,” or reliance on transferring the economic activity of new users directly to old users instead of creating value and distributing that value. When the token does not make the product better in a clear way (other than raising money), it’s a strong sign that the token has not been well designed. Be especially wary about your token mechanisms when designing products that involve collateral assets and/or oracles. While builders may be wary of chasing users off with tokenomics that ask holders to take on risks, designs that offer holders both benefits and put their skin-in-the-game may actually lead to the best results.",
        "Launching a token has both pros and cons, and builders need to carefully weigh them, as once launched, it’s very difficult to gracefully “unlaunch” a token—doing so almost always wastes time and damages reputation. Pros include easier fundraising, benefiting user acquisition, enabling community ownership, supporting multichain functionality, and enabling new products. Cons include reputation risk or damage, legal risks, diverting resources from the core product, and introducing additional complexities and economic exploit risks that smart contract audits are not designed to catch. This checklist helps builders determine whether it may be appropriate to launch a token and, if so, when the right time may be to do so. You probably don’t ever need a token if you don’t meet the following criteria. At least one of the following must apply: the product intends to be either fully decentralized, permissionless, or community-owned/operated; the token benefits the product itself (e.g., the product will be faster, simpler, less expensive, more secure, etc., than possible without a token); or the token will be a native form of gas or currency to a chain, or it represents or tracks a value pegged to an off-chain or on-chain asset (e.g., stablecoins, carbon credits). Additionally, at least one of the following must apply: the token is used for reputation (not transferable, no explicit monetary value); the token has legitimate use cases and utility for holders (providing liquidity, staking to earn more of the same token, and price speculation trading are not legitimate utilities); or the token can financially reward holders via buybacks, revenue distributions, or similar mechanisms funded by paying users of the protocol, not ponzinomic transfers of wealth (you must be conscious of legal/regulatory aspects if this is the option you’re relying on—speak to your legal representation). Even if you need a token at some point, you probably aren’t ready to launch one until you meet these additional criteria. Launching the token now will materially help with at least one of the following: attracting new users you are able to retain (you have product-market fit); retaining existing users (even when emissions decline); protecting from competitors (defending against a vampire attack); or enabling significant community control and governance (not decentralization theater). Additionally, at least one of the following must be true: the core team is prepared to operate a “public company”; the core team is ready to fully abdicate responsibility to token holders, and token holders are ready to take full control of day-to-day governance and operations; or there is no “core team” to begin with, or all of the contracts have been deployed and are non-upgradeable and immutable (e.g., Bitcoin or Liquity). At least one of the following must also apply: the product has achieved “sufficient decentralization” (legal risks may still apply); you will not be selling tokens to unaccredited US investors (there may still be regulatory implications for tokens given away for free to these investors); or you have registered your token offering sale with the SEC or the relevant regulator for your jurisdiction such as the MAS in Singapore. Furthermore, your token launch plan must have been reviewed by a knowledgeable legal professional. The simple framework at the end of the chapter can help to quickly evaluate if a token is right for your product and if now is the right time.",
        "Regulatory bodies in Switzerland and Singapore have similar guidance on token classes for payment, utility, and securities/assets, though these classes are not mutually exclusive. Unofficial industry classifications of tokens do not assume tokens are necessarily fungible tokens rather than non-fungible tokens, and in many cases, such as reputation, governance, pegged, and more, can make use of NFTs or FTs. It is generally unwise to launch a non-stablecoin token meant to function as a medium of exchange unless it is within a very specific economy, such as an in-game currency. It is extremely difficult to retain a strict peg without the option to redeem the token for the underlying pegged asset, no matter how liquid or illiquid that asset may be. Governance tokens create additional room for abuses, exploits, and malicious governance takeovers, in addition to handing potential control of crucial aspects of the product to users who sometimes have drastically less domain expertise. Community governance is not required to build decentralized or user-owned products; it is a subjective political decision or design objective—not a technical requirement, and often not a regulatory requirement either. Always speak to a registered legal professional before launching a token. L1, L2, and dApp tokens will almost always have different objectives. Blindly copy-pasting L1 tokenomics into the context of a dApp, or vice versa, is not sound design.",
        "The biggest tokenomics mistakes to avoid: Not Knowing Why You Need a Token: The most common mistake builders make is not knowing why or how a token will actually benefit your product and your users. These builders are often interested in launching a token purely to raise money and then try to work backward to create a need for the token. Just as you wouldn’t start a company “in order to be an entrepreneur,” launching a token “to have a token” is not the right approach. Both crypto and traditional business models alike start with solving a problem and creating something useful that people want or need. Consider revisiting Chapter 1.4 to evaluate if a token actually makes sense for your situation. Not Planning Ahead: Whereas the first mistake is having a token before a product, the second mistake is having a product that isn’t designed with a token in mind and then launching a token after the fact without considering the product implications. For example, Uniswap is still struggling to activate the “fee switch,” and until they do, the UNI token is purely a governance token with dubious value beyond speculation that UNI will capture fees in the future. Part of this may have been due to the fact that the launch of UNI was largely rushed to defend against the SushiSwap vampire attack. Uniswap could have still launched their product first and their token later—doing so remains a common tactic for many crypto products. However, when doing so, it’s important to plan ahead for how the token fits into and benefits the product, even if you have no plans to actually launch the token yet. In Uniswap’s case, that could have meant turning on a very small protocol fee or having the treasury collect a protocol fee and still distribute it to LPs. This way the overall economics for traders and LPs would remain the same, but a product mechanism for collecting fees to the treasury would already exist and merely need to be re-activated instead of implemented from scratch. We’ll discuss Uniswap’s situation and token value accrual more in Chapter 2.2. Not Knowing What Type of Token You’re Issuing: Another common mistake is not knowing what type of token you’re issuing—for example, thinking your token is a utility token merely because it has one minor piece of utility when in reality it possesses many characteristics of an asset token. This increases your legal risk since you don’t know how your token will likely fit into existing regulatory frameworks that specify specific token types. It also makes it easy to fool yourself into excusing a poorly designed token that has no utility by assuming that your token will be used as a medium of exchange (currency) or a store of value (e.g., Bitcoin, gold). In reality, the vast majority of tokens will never become a store of value or general medium of exchange, and assuming it will, or using a design that requires it to, is delusional. Along the same lines, if you’re introducing a utility token, make sure it has actual utility. Taking a useless token and adding staking to earn more of the same token does not give it utility. Revisit Chapter 1.5 for more about types of tokens and different forms of utility. Relying on Always Increasing Prices: Builders that optimize for “number go up technology” will find that all the growth that seems to come as the token price rises will just as quickly evaporate once the price declines. Builders cannot rely on prices always going up. Volatility and random events are part of life. People sell tokens for all sorts of rational and irrational reasons. Risks and rewards are subjective, and users will eventually sell tokens even if they “shouldn’t” do it. Sustainably incentivizing holding is one thing, but designing mechanisms that strictly prevent selling, or assuming no one will ever sell, is a surefire way to destroy your product. If your token is built assuming no one will ever sell, user activity will always grow, or your token price will always increase, your product will not survive. Underestimating Collateral Risks: Using collateral is sometimes unavoidable. For example, enabling users to mint DAI requires them to post collateral. If you mint DAI without collateral, there would be nothing backing the stablecoin, and the entire product simply would not work. Yet even when strictly necessary, collateral always means risk. Looking at surface-level assumptions of price, market cap, and market liquidity can be extremely misleading when assessing these risks. Market cap structurally overestimates the value of collateral when the value of that collateral is most important—when people start selling it. Builders too often overestimate the value, liquidity, and diversification of collateral assets because they make assumptions based on normal market conditions, not based on conditions during market downturns when collateral liquidations would be occurring. We’ll discuss risk modeling more and introduce a specific framework for assessing and managing risk in Chapter 2.6. Assuming Product Usage Means Token Demand: It’s common to assume the more a product is used, the more demand for the token there’ll be—however, this is not necessarily the case and heavily depends on a product’s tokenomics. Devoid of clear value capture and value accrual, there is often no fundamental reason more usage translates into more demand. Assuming product usage translates to token demand is not realistic; it depends on the tokenomics, especially on the utility, value capture, and value accrual mechanisms. Only Focusing on Token Supply: When discussing tokenomics, people almost always discuss allocation, emission schedules, inflation rates, burns, the total number of tokens, and tokens in circulation. Yet these are all supply aspects, and supply is only one piece of the puzzle. Scarcity alone is not enough. Reducing inflation is not enough. Removing sell pressure is not enough. Deflationary pressures that are not properly balanced can paralyze economic activity since people begin to hoard the token instead of using it for its intended purpose. Builders need to think about token demand, use cases, incentive mechanisms, and value drivers just as much, if not more, than supply. Not Modeling and Stress Testing: Incentives are tough to get right, and even if the overall system is sound in design, it is highly unlikely that you pick the optimal parameters without modeling and stress testing. Many builders don’t know where to start with optimization and testing, resulting in arbitrary emissions schedules, undetected death spirals, hidden assumptions, and unrealistic expectations of risk. Methods such as Monte Carlo simulations, boundary testing, and scenario analysis, which are common in TradFi and systems engineering, could help identify risks early. Every serious builder knows to audit their smart contracts, but ensuring the code is supposed to do the right thing is even more important. Ignoring Regulatory Risks: Crypto founders have gone to jail for ignoring regulatory risks. Take it seriously. Just because someone else uses a certain tokenomics model and hasn’t yet been sued or arrested doesn’t mean the same applies to you. Life’s not fair. The recent crackdowns on Tornado Cash, including the arrest of a developer guilty of the ‘crime’ of contributing code to an open-source project, highlight the importance of taking regulatory risks seriously. This guide is not legal advice, but Chapter 2.7 compiles informational tips and resources from legal professionals in the industry.",
        "The conversation with the founders interested in tokenomics is always structured based on your given knowledge about tokenomics, as well as the following important structures: You always go through a structured approach with founders giving them the best start for their tokenomics. It goes like the following: Step 1 is defined as Objectives & Requirements where different roles within the ecosystem are defined, and their problems, solutions, and the benefits of using a token are analyzed. The first step is to identify key roles in the ecosystem and fill out a table (the founder does this). The relevant actors in the system must first be defined. In a liquidity pool ecosystem as an example of a tokenomics project, typical roles might include Liquidity Providers (users who provide liquidity to the platform), Traders (users who execute trades), and Liquidity Bribers (projects that incentivize liquidity for their tokens). Once the roles are identified, the next step is to analyze their problems and how they currently solve them. In column (1B), the key issue users face is described. For example, liquidity providers may have assets that do not generate income. In column (1C), alternative solutions before the product existed are listed. In the case of Curve as a successful project, users might have previously provided liquidity in volatile pools or used centralized lending platforms. The following columns examine how the product and token address these issues. Column (1D) describes how the product helps users. Curve, for example, allows liquidity providers to earn yield with reduced impermanent loss. Column (1E) explains the benefits of network effects, such as increased liquidity leading to deeper pools and improved trading efficiency. Column (1F) details how the token enhances these benefits, for instance, by enabling governance over liquidity rewards, making the system more interactive. Finally, column (1G) clarifies why users want to hold the token. This should be based on real utility rather than speculation. In the case of CRV, the token of the Curve ecosystem, token holders can vote on reward distribution and receive protocol revenue. Good tokenomics creates a win-win-win for all stakeholders. A token should have clear utility beyond speculation or fundraising. The Objectives & Requirements step is iterative meaning revisions are expected and necessary for a strong token model. The Value Accrual step is the second stage to teach the founder in the seven-step tokenomics design process. This step focuses on understanding how value is created, captured, and ultimately accrues to the token. Even small design choices in value capture mechanisms can have a significant impact on a protocol’s success. A key concept in value accrual is distinguishing between value creation, value capture, and value accrual. Value creation refers to the benefits a product provides to users—such as Uber making transportation easier or Curve allowing liquidity providers to earn yield. Value capture is the mechanism through which the protocol retains a portion of that value, typically through fees. Finally, value accrual determines how the captured value benefits the token. If any of these three elements are missing, the token lacks real utility and becomes purely speculative. To structure this process, a second table is used by the user, similar to the previous table. The first column (2A) lists the roles in the ecosystem, which remain consistent across all steps. Typical roles include liquidity providers, traders, and liquidity bribers as seen in the first table. For each role, the table is completed as follows: (2B) What value does your product create for them? This identifies the core benefit provided to users. In the case of Curve, liquidity providers earn yield from trading fees. Without Curve, they might struggle to generate passive income from their assets. (2C) How does your product capture value from them? Here, the focus is on how the protocol generates revenue. Curve captures value by directing a portion of trading fees to the protocol. (2D) What are the frictions or costs to capturing this value from them? While capturing value is necessary for sustainability, it also introduces trade-offs. For example, charging protocol fees reduces the yield for liquidity providers, which may discourage participation. The design must balance these effects to maintain a competitive ecosystem. (2E) What makes the value capture defensible? A defensible value capture model ensures that users continue engaging with the protocol despite the fees. In the case of Curve, deep liquidity and governance incentives create a strong user base that sustains protocol revenue. (2F) How does this captured value accrue to the token? The final step connects the captured value to token utility. In Curve’s case, protocol revenues are distributed to token holders, creating direct value accrual. Other mechanisms could include offering exclusive services, discounts, or governance rights that enhance token demand. By completing the second table and questions, the relationship between value creation, capture, and accrual is clearly defined by the tokenomics builder. This process helps refine tokenomics design, ensuring that the token plays an integral role in the ecosystem rather than being a speculative afterthought. The Lifecycle Patterns step is the third phase in the seven-step tokenomics design process. This step examines how a token is created, transferred, used, and destroyed. Understanding these dynamics ensures a sustainable token economy by balancing supply and demand through well-defined faucets (sources of token issuance) and sinks (ways tokens are removed from circulation). The Lifecycle Patterns Table the founder should do consists of four key questions. The first question, (3A) How is the token created?, focuses on identifying the mechanisms behind token issuance. Tokens can be emitted through various methods, such as mining, staking rewards, farming, airdrops, or being minted based on protocol metrics like revenue or total value locked (TVL). In the case of Curve’s CRV token, issuance follows a predefined schedule where liquidity providers receive emissions, and governance determines the distribution of these emissions. The second question, (3B) Is the token transferable?, determines whether a token can be traded freely. Not all tokens should be transferable—for example, reputation or social status tokens would lose their value if they could be bought and sold. A real-world example is Twitter’s verification system: when users were able to buy blue checkmarks, it led to impersonation issues and reduced trust in the system. In the case of CRV, the token is transferable unless it is staked as vote-escrowed CRV (veCRV), which temporarily locks the tokens in return for governance power. The third question, (3C) How is the token used?, explores the various utilities of the token. Tokens can serve as payment, provide discounts, act as collateral, or enable access to certain services. In CRV’s case, staking as veCRV allows holders to influence emissions distribution and earn protocol fees. Unexpected token use cases should also be considered. For example, Convex Finance emerged as a major holder of CRV, creating a new layer of governance competition within the ecosystem. The final question, (3D) How is the token destroyed?, analyzes whether the token supply is reduced over time. Token burns, expirations, and decay mechanisms help manage inflation and ensure long-term sustainability. While CRV itself is not burned, vote-escrowed CRV decays over time, meaning users who lock tokens for governance influence gradually lose voting power. Without this mechanism, early adopters could accumulate disproportionate control over the protocol, leading to governance centralization. By completing this third table, the full lifecycle of a token is clearly mapped, ensuring a well-balanced and sustainable token economy. Understanding both faucets and sinks is critical in maintaining economic stability and preventing supply imbalances. The Incentive Mechanisms Framework is another next crucial step in the tokenomics design process, ensuring that behaviors within the ecosystem align with long-term sustainability and value creation. Poorly designed incentives can lead to value redistribution rather than value creation, which can cause unsustainable growth patterns, economic inefficiencies, or outright failure. Before setting specific rewards or penalties, the first step is to define who is incentivized and what behaviors are encouraged or discouraged. The builder and founder should do a  worksheet which is structured to systematically map out the incentives and disincentives to optimize participant behavior. The first section (Columns A-G) defines the role of each participant and their behavioral patterns. (4A) Role specifies different actors in the ecosystem. In this example, a role like Collectors is defined. (4B) Desired Behaviors lists the actions we want these actors to take, such as actively participating in governance, contributing liquidity, or staking tokens. (4C) Frictions to Desired Behaviors identifies obstacles that might prevent these actions, such as time constraints, lack of information, or high transaction fees. Next, (4D) Undesired Behaviors outlines harmful actions that should be discouraged, like hoarding tokens without engagement or engaging in governance attacks. (4E) Motivations for Undesired Behaviors explores why users might act against the protocol’s best interests—this could be profit-seeking behaviors, lack of penalties, or simply an easier alternative. The second section (Columns F-G) introduces mechanisms to shape user behavior. (4F) Incentive Mechanisms define how to encourage positive engagement, such as rewarding voting participation, staking bonuses, or providing governance power for active contributors. (4G) Disincentive Mechanisms focus on discouraging undesired behaviors through methods like penalties for inactivity, slashing mechanisms, or economic barriers to prevent governance manipulation. Once all roles and mechanisms are outlined, the final section (Columns H-I) ensures that incentives and disincentives are balanced. (4H) Mechanism Conflicts helps identify potential contradictions—such as rewarding engagement while also introducing high barriers to participation, which might lead to spam or low-quality votes. (4I) Possible Resolutions & Open Questions addresses conflicts by proposing solutions, like slashing bad actors while ensuring governance participation remains meaningful. One of the biggest challenges in incentive design is avoiding overcompensation for behaviors that could create systemic issues. For instance, simply rewarding voting in a DAO can lead to low-quality participation or even Sybil attacks. Similarly, extreme penalties for inactivity might discourage participation altogether. Balancing direction (encouraging good behaviors while limiting bad ones), relative scale (ensuring rewards and punishments are proportionate), and magnitude (finding the right numerical balance through simulations and governance testing) is key. By completing this Incentive Mechanisms Framework which is created, projects can refine their tokenomics strategy, ensuring that incentives drive real value creation rather than just speculative growth. This structured approach enables governance models that are self-sustaining, scalable, and resistant to manipulation, ensuring a healthy and fair token economy. The Supply Policy step is the fifth phase in the seven-step tokenomics design process, focusing on token issuance, vesting, and allocation. While often overemphasized, supply policies should be designed with best practices in mind, ensuring consistency and sustainability rather than aiming to be unique. One of the most common misconceptions among builders is the obsession with max supply. The total number of tokens, whether 10 million, 100 million, or 1 billion, is largely arbitrary as long as it remains consistent. For example, Bitcoin’s 21 million cap could just as easily have been 21 billion or 2.1 million. The critical factor is predictability, not the specific number itself. Moreover, not all tokens need a max supply. Examples like stablecoins (USDC, DAI) or carbon credits (MC02) demonstrate that tokens can be issued dynamically based on demand. Even Ethereum has no max supply, yet it remains a valuable asset due to its network utility and the introduction of deflationary mechanisms. A well-designed supply policy should also consider emissions schedules and vesting mechanisms. Empirical evidence shows that continuous (block-by-block) vesting is more effective than periodic vesting (e.g., quarterly unlocks). This ensures smoother token distribution, avoiding large cliffs that could lead to volatility. Inflation vs. deflation is another key topic—while deflationary models (e.g., token burns) can add value, they are not sufficient on their own. Many projects have failed by relying solely on burns for price appreciation. Likewise, inflation isn’t inherently bad if controlled and predictable, as seen in Monero’s tail emissions or NounsDAO’s daily NFT auctions. When designing a supply policy, it is crucial to align with industry standards rather than reinvent the wheel. A balanced allocation ensures fairness and long-term sustainability. Typical token distribution norms include: Team (15-20%), Advisors (3-6%), Investors (10-20%), Treasury (15-30%), Community rewards (20-50%), and an Initial Unlock or Airdrop (5-10%). The vesting schedule should also follow best practices: Teams (5+ years), Advisors (3+ years), and Investors (2+ years). Empirical data suggests that projects with 50% of total supply in circulation after two years perform the best, balancing token scarcity with market liquidity. To streamline this process, many builders use token modeling templates, which provide predefined vesting schedules, emission curves, and supply allocation charts. These templates allow for quick adjustments to variables like cliffs, delays, and vesting periods, ensuring an optimized token release schedule. While linear vesting distributes tokens equally over time, sigmoid emission curves offer advantages by starting with lower emissions, allowing projects to establish product-market fit before ramping up distribution, and gradually tapering off emissions over time. Ultimately, supply policy is just one part of the equation—demand, utility, and ecosystem incentives are equally important. A well-structured supply framework should focus on consistency, fairness, and alignment with best practices, rather than trying to stand out with unconventional allocation models. By leveraging industry norms and modeling tools, builders can avoid common pitfalls and create sustainable token economies. The Modeling and Optimization step is the sixth phase in the seven-step tokenomics design process, focusing on risk analysis, assumption validation, and incentive optimization. Unlike common misconceptions, modeling is not about predicting token price but rather about identifying vulnerabilities and optimizing economic parameters for sustainable and balanced tokenomics. A fundamental principle of modeling is leveraging market-validated data instead of purely theoretical models. Studying comparable projects (market comps) provides real-world insights into network growth, adoption rates, price fluctuations, and revenue models. Even when generating random projections, it is more realistic to base them on historical data rather than assumptions pulled from thin air. The primary goals of modeling are identifying key assumptions that must hold true, quantifying breaking points and risks, and optimizing equilibrium points for incentives. Every tokenomics system operates on assumptions, and by clearly defining them, developers can ensure they are well understood by stakeholders. Some assumptions may not hold true, so it is essential to stress-test failure scenarios and mitigate damages if those conditions fail. The incentive mechanism framework (from the previous step) highlights which parameters need balancing, and modeling helps determine optimal levels for emissions, rewards, and fees. Effective modeling helps prevent catastrophic failures and exploit vulnerabilities before they occur. Emission schedules and market conditions can create arbitrage opportunities, where users artificially inflate trading volume to farm token rewards. Modeling can help predict wash trading incentives and suggest fee or emission adjustments to prevent abuse. Events like Terra Luna’s collapse and Mango Markets' exploit could have been predicted and mitigated through proper scenario testing. Modeling can simulate liquidation events and ensure collateral remains sufficient under extreme conditions. Testing Proof-of-Stake or Proof-of-Work models under different economic conditions can predict decentralization effects, miner behavior, and security vulnerabilities. There are two main approaches to tokenomics modeling. Deterministic Modeling uses spreadsheets like Excel or Google Sheets to analyze fixed assumptions, relying on empirical data and manual scenario testing. It is accessible and easy to understand but lacks the ability to detect complex interactions and hidden risks. Stochastic Modeling, on the other hand, involves coding simulations in Python, CADCAD, TokenSpice, or Machinations to generate thousands of randomized scenarios. This approach captures probability-weighted risks and provides a more comprehensive risk analysis by testing multiple variables simultaneously. While it requires technical expertise, it is essential for detecting non-obvious vulnerabilities. The key to effective modeling is replicating the system’s mechanics while testing both controlled and external variables. Controlled inputs include token emissions, fee structures, governance models, liquidity incentives, and risk control mechanisms. External inputs, such as price volatility, user growth rates, and oracle failures, are factors outside of the protocol’s control but must be accounted for in stress testing. By varying both sets of inputs, the model can simulate vulnerabilities and stress-test system resilience. A structured way to think about risks is through the Economic Security Framework, which helps identify critical assumptions and stress-test failure points. In an NFT borrowing marketplace, for example, borrowers assume that their NFTs are worth what the oracle reports. If the price is incorrect, the system could become undercollateralized. A possible solution is to use a moving average price instead of a single price feed to reduce manipulation risk. Additionally, limiting the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio for illiquid NFTs can help minimize potential losses. Lenders, on the other hand, assume that they can sell the NFT at a reasonable price if liquidation occurs. To increase confidence, the system could allow pre-bidding on liquidations to ensure a guaranteed buyer exists. Another safeguard would be to set a high maintenance margin requirement, which triggers liquidation at a safer threshold. These measures ensure that the system remains resilient under extreme conditions. To model wash trading risks in an NFT marketplace, historical data from comparable platforms like LooksRare can be used to analyze market cap to trading volume ratios. By simulating token emissions alongside trading volume trends, we can estimate at what point wash trading becomes profitable. If emissions outweigh transaction fees, there is a risk of excessive market manipulation. Adjusting trading fees, emission schedules, or reward mechanisms can help mitigate these risks. A deterministic model sets fixed assumptions for market growth and emissions, but a stochastic model runs thousands of simulations with randomized inputs to identify probability-weighted risks. Using Bitcoin and Ethereum price data, for example, thousands of random price paths can be generated based on historical variance. Feeding these simulations into token models can reveal how frequently collateralization ratios fail, wash trading remains profitable, and token emissions behave under extreme market conditions. By simulating hundreds or thousands of different market scenarios, stochastic modeling provides deeper risk insights that deterministic models alone cannot. Without rigorous testing, tokenomics models are prone to exploits, systemic failures, or unsustainable economics. Deterministic modeling is useful for basic projections and initial planning, while stochastic modeling is necessary for deep risk analysis and optimizing incentive structures. The Economic Security Framework helps identify critical assumptions and potential failure points, ensuring a robust and sustainable economic model. The last step includes getting legal advice on everything, specifically for the founders jurisdiction. TokenFuse is not a financial advisor. This model is complete and the user asking about tokenomics can still talk to TokenFuse but is done being guided through this seven-step model."
